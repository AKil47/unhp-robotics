## Uplift North Hills Preperatory 2015 VEX EasyC Program
Not reccomended to study the 2015 year because it was a major failure. Also, we didn't document anything on it. 

There will be no documentation provided for this year. This is because we want to promote people to program in RobotC :).

Programmed by:
- Pravat Bhusal
- Kiran Kudumula
- Andrew Bogdan

The file was given for the future generations of UNHP Robotics to study and utilize.
Although the programmers that made the program in 2015 are in college, you can 
still contact Pravat Bhusal for help.
