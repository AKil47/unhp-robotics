## Uplift North Hills Preperatory 2015 VEX EasyC Program
Seriously, EasyC really sucks. Our team reccomends learning how to program in RobotC.
Welp, whatever... We used EasyC in 2015 because we were starting a new "era" of Robotics with newbies that had no idea wtf we were doing.

There will be no documentation provided for this year. This is because we want to promote people to program in RobotC :).
