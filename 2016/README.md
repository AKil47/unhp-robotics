## Uplift North Hills Preperatory 2016 VEX RobotC Program
This is the RobotC program for the 2016 Uplift North Hills Preperatory VEX RobotC competition. All documentations & setup will be provided here for the future generation to study & understand. If you're having issues, please post them on the issue tab of this GitHub.

## Documentation

How to Download & Compile the RobotC Program:
- Turn the Vex Microcontroller on
- Click the "Robot" tab in RobotC, then go to VEX Cortex Communication Mode, and make sure it's set to "VEXnet or USB."
- Using the orange cord in your returnable kit, connect the Vex Microcontroller to the computer
- Click the "Robot" tab in RobotC, press "Download & Compile" (this downloads & compiles the code to our robot)
- When it finishes downloading & compiling, a popup should appear, x that popup out
- While the Vex microcontroller is still connected to the computer, turn the microcontroller off, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on, then disconnect the microcontroller from the computer
- Now plug in the wireless USB drives to the Vex Joystick & Vex Microcontroller
- Turn the Vex Joystick on
- Test the program!

## Motors continously spin on Joystick ports FIX:
We had this problem for about a week, but after thorough research we got the solution.
The problem is with the VEX Joystick not being calibrated. Here are the steps:
- Turn off and disconnect the VEX Microcontroller from the VEX Joystick
- Turn on the VEX Joystick
- Hold down the channel 6 UP Button
- While holding the channel 6 UP BUtton, hold down the little config button in the middle of your VEX Joystick (you'll need a paperclip to click that small Config button)
- Once the lights start flashing, then release the channel 6 UP Button and Config Button
- QUICK! YOU ONLY HAVE 10 SECONDS: Now move your left and right joystick sticks around to their maximum positions, and once the joystick light is fully green with no flashes, then hold the Channel 8 UP button for 5 seconds and let go
- Finished! Test your robot!

- NOTE: We are using white vex net keys (a vex net key is the wireless USB) for best robotics.
