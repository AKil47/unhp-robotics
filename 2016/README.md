## Uplift North Hills Preperatory 2016 VEX RobotC Program
This is the RobotC program for the 2016 Uplift North Hills Preperatory VEX RobotC competition. 
- All documentations & setup will be provided here for anyone to study
- If you're having an issue, please post your issue on this repository

## How to Download and Compile the RobotC Program:
- Turn the Vex Microcontroller on
- Click the "Robot" tab in RobotC, then go to VEX Cortex Communication Mode, and make sure it's set to "VEXnet or USB."
- Using the orange cord in your returnable kit, connect the Vex Microcontroller to the computer
- Click the "Robot" tab in RobotC, press "Download & Compile" (this downloads & compiles the code to our robot)
- When it finishes downloading & compiling, a popup should appear, x that popup out
- While the Vex microcontroller is still connected to the computer, turn the microcontroller off, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on, then disconnect the microcontroller from the computer
- Now plug in the wireless USB drives to the Vex Joystick & Vex Microcontroller
- Turn the Vex Joystick on
- Finished, now test the program and see if it works

## Calibration
Always calibrate your joystick the moment you receive the Returnable kit.
We forgot to calibrate when we received the kit, and our motors were spinning uncontrollably for a week.
Here are the steps to calibrate your joystick:
- Turn off and disconnect the VEX Microcontroller from the VEX Joystick
- Turn on the VEX Joystick
- Hold down the channel 6 UP Button
- While holding the channel 6 UP Button, hold down the little config button in the middle of your VEX Joystick (you'll need a paperclip to click that small Config button)
- Once the lights start flashing, then release the channel 6 UP Button and Config Button
- You only have 10 seconds: Now move your left and right joystick sticks around to their maximum positions, and once the joystick light is fully green with no flashes, then hold the Channel 8 UP button for 5 seconds and let go
- Finished, now test the robot and see if it works
